You can easily initialize the panel using\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nColorPicker colorPicker = new ColorPicker(true, true);\r\ncolorPicker.addColorListener(colorModel -> System.out.println(colorModel.getColor()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a color picker component with expert controls and opacity settings. If the user selects a color, the color listener will be notified.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`\r\n3.
